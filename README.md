# Edx_labs
The purpose of these labs is to teach you the fundamentals of interacting with web APIs using Angular and HttpClient.
Tutorial Labs
Creating Interfaces

In this lab, you will learn how to create interfaces in TypeScript to define the output coming from the API in a type-safe fashion. You will then use the interface to define the output coming from the GitHub Search API.

Creating Services

In this lab, you will generate a Service to encapsulate your API interactions and in a way that Dependency Injection can make the service available through the app. You will also import the interface that was created in the last labs. You will also create a method that uses a simple caching strategy and will form the basis for retrieving data.

Using HttpClient

In this lab, you will extend the service created in the previous lab to use HttpClient. You will learn how to use promises instead of observables and will retrieve data from the GitHub API.
